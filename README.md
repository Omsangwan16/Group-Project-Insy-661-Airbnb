# Group-Project-Insy-661-Airbnb

In this project, we are hosting a live website on which we are hosting our database live, providing the users an option to interact with the database using the pre-defined queries 
or by writing their own queries for which we even have a relational schema in place for reference.

We have built a dummy database for Airbnb and utilized the Streamlit library to design and host the website.

You can interact with our website here; https://group-project-insy-661-airbnb.streamlit.app/
